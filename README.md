# hello-world
My first repository! This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Khadija and at the time of writing this I am a first year student studying Computer Science here in the UK! 
I intend to use this github profile as a portfolio to highlight the personal projects I have worked on and what I have learned from them.
I look forward to all the exciting projects I will be working on ! :)
